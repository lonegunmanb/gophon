# Go Project Remote Code Indexing Tool - Development Plan

## Project Overview ✅ COMPLETED
Build a comprehensive Go project indexing system that provides remote access to code definitions, types, methods, and functions through MCP (Model Context Protocol). This tool aims to reduce token usage and context noise when AI agents need to access specific code information from remote repositories.

## Phase 1: Core Indexing Engine Enhancement ✅ COMPLETED

### 1.1 Extend AST Analysis Capabilities ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **Test Harness Design**: Create test subjects with examples of all Go constructs for indexing validation
- [x] **Data Structure Design**: Define core data structures for storing indexed Go code information
- [x] **Range Type Implementation**: Added Range type with embedded *FileInfo and String() method for line extraction
- [x] **Constant Declarations**: Parse and extract package-level constants with proper Range information
- [x] **Variable Declarations**: Parse global and package-level variables with blank identifier filtering
- [x] **Type Definitions**: Extract all type definitions including structs (with field names, types, and tags), interfaces (with method signatures), type aliases, and custom types
- [x] **Function Definitions**: Extract standalone functions (non-method functions)
- [x] **IndexableSymbol Interface**: Design and implement a new interface with `IndexFileName()` method that `FunctionInfo`, `TypeInfo`, `VariableInfo`, and `ConstantInfo` implement. This interface generates predictable, unique file names that AI agents can easily guess when reading Go source code (e.g., `type.TypeName.goindex`, `func.FunctionName.goindex`, `method.ReceiverType.MethodName.goindex`, `var.VariableName.goindex`). Constants use `var.` prefix to unify with variables for simplified AI agent lookups.
- [x] **Recursive Package Scanner**: Implement `ScanPackagesRecursively` function that accepts `pkgPath`, `basePkgUrl` parameters and a callback function. The callback receives `*PackageInfo` and `pkgUrl` string parameters. This function will scan the specified package using `ScanSinglePackage`, invoke the callback with results, then recursively scan all subdirectories containing Go packages within the current module scope.
- [x] **Index File Generator**: Implement `IndexSourceCode` function that accepts `pkgPath`, `basePkgUrl`, and `destFolder` parameters. Uses `ScanPackagesRecursively` with a callback to write all indexable symbols to individual `.goindex` files in the destination folder, maintaining the package directory structure with secure file permissions (0700/0600).
- [x] **Blank Identifier Filtering**: Skip variables with blank identifier `_` during indexing to avoid generating unnecessary index files for discarded values.

## Additional Features Implemented
- [x] **Comprehensive Test Suite**: Full test coverage for all indexing functionality
- [x] **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with informative warning messages
- [x] **File System Abstraction**: Uses afero for testable file system operations
- [x] **Security**: Secure file permissions (0700 for directories, 0600 for files)

## Project Status: ✅ READY FOR PRODUCTION USE

The core indexing engine is complete and production-ready. All essential features have been implemented and thoroughly tested:

### Core Features ✅

- ✅ Full test coverage

### Technical Excellence ✅
- ✅ Clean, maintainable code architecture
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite with real-world scenarios
- ✅ Proper error handling and user feedback
- ✅ Security-conscious file permissions
- ✅ Performance-optimized AST processing

## Technical Stack
- **Language**: Go (for performance and Go-native AST parsing)
- **Storage**: File system with structured Go code files
- **Dependencies**: golang.org/x/tools/go/packages, go/ast, go/token, github.com/spf13/afero
